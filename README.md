CheckSumer
==========

A simple Windows checksum program.

This simple .NET application allows the user to drag-and-drop a file into the 
window and will present them with MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 checksums of that 
file.

Running CheckSumer
------------------

To run the application, you must have the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 installed on your system.

Double-click on checksumer.exe.

Locate the file on which you wish to view checksum information, then drag-and-drop it into the gray 
box in the CheckSumer window.
